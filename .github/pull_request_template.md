As all changes are publicly made available via PRs, you must agree to the terms before contributing:

- [ ] I represent that each of _my contributions_ is entirely _my original work_
- [ ] I have sole ownership of intellectual property rights to _my contribution_
- [ ] I approve that the community is free to use _my contribution_

Make sure that you have checked all tick boxes before this PR can be approved.
